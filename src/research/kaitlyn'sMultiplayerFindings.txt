When extensively researching real-time multiplayer, it became clear that the website hosting 
application chosen was not going to be an option due to it being mostly for php/mysql coding. 
Unfortunately, there is no way to install Node.js or anything else for that matter even if the 
site were to be upgraded. This information can be found when clicking the following links, 
https://www.000webhost.com/forum/t/hosting-a-game-server/18273 and 
https://www.000webhost.com/forum/t/how-to-add-node-js-on-free-webhosting-plan/116362. 
With classes and job schedules, it was a bit difficult to find a lot of time to put aside to 
figure out a whole different platform that is able to install node.js. If we were able to use 
NodeJs with the website hosting application, we would most likely being using node.js and web sockets 
to allow fast two-way communication between the server and the client. Many of the websites I was 
reading were suggesting at least the use of node.js, it’s very unfortunate the web app we used in 
the beginning doesn’t support it… There are web hosting applications that do support node.js and 
socket.io, but it’s very time consuming learning the functions of a different web hosting app and 
then trying to figure out coding in node.js/socket.io. Hopefully, this is a task the group can possibly 
work on in the future.
